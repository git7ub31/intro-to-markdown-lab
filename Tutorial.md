# Creating the Perfect Sandwich
Cooking for yourself is an essential part of life. 
`Sandwich-making is one of the most crucial skills you can learn to get ahead. `
Here's a step-by-step tutorial to help you start:

## Ingredients: 
- **bread**
- **mayonnaise**
- **cheese slice**
- **your choice of deli meats**
- **tomato**
- **lettuce**

> different kinds of bread and/or condiments will help enhance the flavor to your liking
>> ensure you are not allergic to any of the above ingredients

## The Making of it: 

*Place* a slice of bread onto the plate. *Spread* your condiment onto the first slice and then start *stacking* your deli meats. After, *cut* a slice of tomato and *place* that onto the building piece. Repeat this step with the *lettuce*. Lastly, place your second slice of *bread* and you are good to go!

` Toasting *(Optional)*`
Putting your sandwich into a bread presser helps crisp the bread and make a warm toasty meal!
